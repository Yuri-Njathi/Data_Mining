    "#### Regular Expressions in identifying emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rule 1 :\n",
    "The first part of an email address contains at least one of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, the numbers 0-9, periods(.) , plus signs(+) or underscores( _ ).  \n",
    "\n",
    "[A-Za-z0-9\\._+]+ \n",
    "The Regex shorthand is pretty smart. \"A-Z\" will mean uppercase letter A through to Z. By putting all the possible sequences and symbols in brackets as opposed to parentheses, you are saing \"This symbol can be any symbol in the brackets.\" The use of the outside + sign means \"these charachters can occur as many times as possible but must occur at least once.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rule 2 : @\n",
    "\n",
    "After this , the email address contains the @ symbol.\n",
    "This is fairly straightforward: the @ symbol must occur in the middle and it must occur exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rule 3 : [A-Za-z]+\n",
    "The email address then must contain at least one uppercase or lowercase letter. \n",
    "You may use only letters in the first part of the domail name after @ and at least one character. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rule 4 : \\.\n",
    "This is followed by a period (.).\n",
    "You must include a period (.) before the domain name. The backspace\n",
    "is used here as an escape charachter.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Rule 5 : (com|org|edu|net)\n",
    "Finally, the email address ends with com, org, edu or net\n",
    "This lists the possible sequences of letters to follow after the period in the second part of the email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By concatenating all the rules, you arrive at the regular expression\n",
    "[A-Za-z0-9\\._+]+@[A-Za-z]+\\.(com|org|edu|net)\n",
    "\n",
    "When attempting to write any regular expression from scratch, it's best to first make a list of steps that concretely outlines what your target string looks like. Pay attention to edge cases. For instance, if you're identifying phone numbers are considering country codes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard version of regular expressions (the one covered in\n",
    "this book and used by Python and BeautifulSoup) is based on syn‐\n",
    "tax used by Perl. Most modern programming languages use this or\n",
    "one similar to it. Be aware, however, that if you are using regular\n",
    "expressions in another language, you might encounter problems.\n",
    "Even some modern languages, such as Java, have slight differences\n",
    "in the way they handle regular expressions. When in doubt, read\n",

    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup and Regular Expressions go hand in hand when it comes to scraping the web. In fact, most functions that take in a string statement (e.g., find(id=\"aTagIdHere\")) will also take in a regular expression just as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some examples, scraping the page found at : http://www.pythonscraping.com/pages/page3.html\n",

    "Notice that the site has many product images, which take the following form:\n",
    "`<img src=\"../img/gifts/img3.jpg\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to grab URLs to all of the product images, it might seem fairly straightforward at first: just grab all the image tags by using .find_all(\"img\") , right? In addition to the obvious \"extra\" images (eg logos) , modern web pages often have hidden images, blank images used for spacing and aligning elements, and other random images tags you might not be aware of. Certainly, you can't count on the only images on the page being product images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the layout of the page might change for whatever reason, you dont have to depend on the position of the image in the page in order to find the correct tag. This may be the case when you when trying to access randomly scattered pieces of data throughout a website. For instance, a featured product image might appear in a special layout at the top of some pages but not others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since no image id , the solution will be to look for something identifying about the tag itself, in this case the image file path."
